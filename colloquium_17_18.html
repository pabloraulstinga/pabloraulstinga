                  complex stochastic evolutionary process. One of the
                  key components of this process is evolving tumors,
                  which interact with and manipulate their surrounding
                  microenvironment in a dynamic spatio-temporal manner.
                  Recently, several computational models have been
                  developed to investigate such a complex phenomenon and
                  to find potential therapeutic targets. In this talk,
                  we present novel computational models to gain some
                  insight about the evolutionary dynamics of cancer.
                  Furthermore, we propose an innovative framework to
                  systematically employ a combination of mathematical
                  methods and bioinformatics techniques to arrive at
                  unique personalized targeted therapies for cancer

                <p><span style="font-size:10.5pt">HIV broadly
                    neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are the major hope
                    for an effective HIV vaccine and therapy
                    development, but are only elicited at low frequency
                    in natural HIV infection. We recently conducted a
                    systematic survey of bnAb activity in 4,484 HIV-1
                    infected individuals, and identified several viral
                    and disease parameters associated with bnAb
                    development, as well as antibody binding patterns
                    predictive of bnAb existence. Through phylogenetic
                    HIV sequence analysis, we further identified more
                    than 300 likely transmission pairs, and exhibited,
                    for the first time, that parts of the HIV antibody
                    response are heritable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
                <span style="font-size:10.5pt">The second part of my
                  talk focuses on the development and analysis of time-
                  and state-discrete dynamical system models
                  (generalized Boolean networks) to better understand
                  GRNs and their surprisingly high robustness to noise
                  and perturbations. My research aims to identify the
                  mechanisms underlying this robustness, by relating
                  network topology to network dynamics. I will
                  characterize the class of canalizing functions, which
                  is well-suited to model the interactions in GRNs, and
                  the occurrence of these functions buffers GRNs against
                  noise.<br>

                  biological populations, from cancer to ecological
                  systems, is ubiquitous.&nbsp;Despite this knowledge,
                  current&nbsp;mathematical models in population biology
                  often do not account for
                  inter-individual&nbsp;heterogeneity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
                  systems such as cancer, this means assuming cellular
                  homogeneity and deterministic phenotypes, despite the
                  fact that heterogeneity is thought to play a role
                  in&nbsp;therapy&nbsp;resistance.&nbsp;Glioblastoma
                  Multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive and fatal form of

                  differential equation (PDE) models of GBM growth. In
                  particular, I will discuss the use of random
                  differential equations for modeling purposes and the
                  Prohorov metric&nbsp;framework for estimating

resolved






































                  a longstanding open statistical problem. The problem,
                  formulated by the British statistician Udny
                  Yule&nbsp;in&nbsp;1926, is to mathematically prove
                  Yule's 1926 empirical finding of "nonsense
                  correlation". We solve the problem by analytically
                  determining the second moment of the empirical
                  correlation coefficient of two independent Wiener
                  processes. Using tools from Fredholm integral equation
                  theory, we calculate the second moment of the
                  empirical correlation to obtain a value for the
                  standard deviation of the empirical correlation of
                  nearly .5. The "nonsense" correlation, which we call
                  "volatile" correlation, is volatile&nbsp;in&nbsp;the
                  sense that its distribution is heavily
                  dispersed&nbsp;and&nbsp;is frequently
                  large&nbsp;in&nbsp;absolute value. It is induced
                  because each Wiener process is "self-correlated"
                  in&nbsp;time. This is because a Wiener process is an
                  integral of pure noise&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus its values
                  at different time points are
                  correlated.&nbsp;In&nbsp;addition to providing an

                  AR-SA">The prevalence of ever-increasing sources of
                  data demands the development of new tools for
                  analysis.&nbsp; Topological data analysis (TDA)
                  provides one such toolbox, relying on geometric and
                  topological methods to highlight features of data that
                  are not apparent using other approaches.&nbsp; A
                  central idea of TDA is to determine the features that
                  persist across multiple scales. These persistent
                  features can be completely described and conveniently
                  visualized due to a structure theorem closely related
                  to the structure theorem for finitely generated
                  abelian groups. In this talk, I will discuss a
                  generalized version of persistence inspired by a
                  parameterized form of Morse theory, and discuss how it
                  can be used in practice.<br>

                  variety of research fields in science and engineering
                  as well as in mathematics. In the human nervous
                  system, synchronization can be beneficial, allowing
                  for production of a vast range of behaviors such as
                  generation of circadian rhythms and emergence of
                  organized bursting in pancreatic beta-cells; or
                  detrimental, causing disorders such as Parkinson‚Äôs

                  heterogeneous nodes and nonuniform coupling structure,
                  complex patterns of synchronization emerge. Finding
                  the conditions that foster synchronization in
                  networked systems is critical to understanding a wide
                  range of biological and mechanical systems. In this
                  talk I introduce several synchronization patterns and
                  identify when synchronization occurs and explain its
                  dependance on parameters such as network structure,
                  coupling weights, and intrinsic nodal dynamics.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span><br>

                  synchronous phenomena in central pattern generators
                  (CPGs). CPGs are sophisticated circuits that can
                  generate complex locomotor behaviors and even switch
                  between different gaits. I discuss the mechanism of
                  gait transition in an oscillator model of CPGs in

                  develop an evolutionary game theoretic version of a
                  general nonlinear matrix model that includes the
                  dynamics of a vector of mean phenotypic traits subject
                  to natural selection. For this evolutionary model, we
                  use bifurcation analysis to establish the existence
                  and stability of a branch of positive equilibria that
                  bifurcates from the extinction equilibrium when the
                  inherent growth rate passes through one. We then
                  present an application to a daphnia model to
                  demonstrate how the evolution of resistance to a
                  toxicant may change persistence scenarios. We show
                  that if the effects of a disturbance are not too
                  large, then it is possible for a daphnia population to
                  evolve toxicant resistance whereby it is able to
                  persist at higher levels of the toxicant than it would
                  otherwise. These results highlight the complexities
                  involved in using surrogate species to examine
                  toxicity. Time permitting, we will also consider a
                  nonautonomous matrix model to examine the possible
                  long-term effects of environmental disturbances, such
                  as oils spills, floods, and fires, on population
                  recovery. We focus on population recovery following a
                  single disturbance, where recovery is defined to be
                  the return to the pre-disturbance population size.
                  Using methods from matrix calculus, we derive explicit
                  formulas for the sensitivity of the recovery time with
                  respect to properties of the population or the
                  disturbance.<br>

                      the transit of red blood cells through the narrow
                      slits in the spleen, involve the near-contact of
                      elastic structures separated by thin layers of
                      fluid. The separation of length scales between
                      these fine lubrication layers and&nbsp;the larger
                      elastic objects&nbsp;poses significant
                      computational challenges. Motivated by the
                      challenge of resolving
                      such&nbsp;multiscale&nbsp;problems, we introduce
                      an immersed boundary method that uses elements of
                      lubrication theory to resolve thin fluid layers
                      between immersed boundaries. We&nbsp;apply this
                      method to two-dimensional flows of increasing

                      near-contact occurs at multiple levels, such as
                      cell-wall, cell-cell, and intracellular
                      interactions, to highlight the importance of

                  humans or other species and understanding their
                  effects on contemporary genetic variability is one of
                  the central tasks of population genetics. The
                  genealogical relationship of a sample&nbsp;of several
                  individuals is commonly modeled by the ancestral
                  recombination graph (ARG). The ARG has a very complex
                  structure and using it for inference is
                  computationally prohibitive. In this talk I will
                  present novel Hidden Markov Models used to approximate
                  the ARG and an effective computational methodology for
                  inference of demographic histories based on these

                  allow for stable analysis and reconstruction of data
                  in Hilbert space. In applications such as compressed
                  sensing and quantum information theory, it is
                  critically important to find examples of frames whose
                  vectors are spread wide apart. In particular, we would
                  like the interior angles between the lines they span
                  to be as wide as possible, as measured by the
                  coherence. This is an old problem, going back at least
                  to the work of van Lint and Seidel in the 1960s, and
                  it remains an active and challenging area of research
                  today. In this talk we will present a new recipe for
                  converting transitive actions of finite groups into
                  tight frames, many of which have optimal coherence.
                  The main idea is to use an association scheme as a
                  kind of converter to pass from the discrete world of
                  permutation groups into the continuous setting of
                  frames. This process is easy to implement in a
                  computer program like GAP. We will present several
                  examples of optimally incoherent frames produced in
                  this way, including the first infinite family of
                  equiangular tight frames with Heisenberg symmetry.

                  physical and intangible structures, such as the
                  internet and collaboration networks, can be abstracted
                  as graphs. With the goal of understanding the various
                  processes that take place on these structures, such as
                  the spread of a virus or the cultivation of an idea,
                  we study stochastic processes on graphs. I will

                  Cutoff&nbsp;is a remarkable property of many Markov
                  chains&nbsp;in&nbsp;which they rapidly transition from
                  an unmixed to a mixed distribution. Most random walks
                  on the symmetric group, also known as card shuffles,
                  are believed to mix with&nbsp;cutoff, but we are far
                  from being able to proof this. We will survey
                  existing&nbsp;cutoff&nbsp;results and techniques for
                  random walks on the symmetric group, and present three
                  recent results:&nbsp;cutoff&nbsp;for a biased
                  transposition walk,&nbsp;cutoff&nbsp;with

                  generated by permutations with a binomially

                  Merrill (1862-1951) was the first American woman to
                  receive a PhD in Mathematics. She had to seek special
                  permission to be admitted to classes at Columbia
                  University and often had to study independently since
                  it was frowned upon for women to attend the lectures.
                  After receiving her degree she opened two schools for
                  girls and spent her career expanding opportunities for
                  women in education and athletics. Euphemia Lofton
                  Haynes (1890-1980) was the first African American
                  woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics. She spent
                  her career teaching in segregated and later
                  desegregated schools in Washington DC, serving on the
                  school board upon retiring. She was a tireless fighter
                  for equal education for all public-school students
                  regardless of race, gender and income. In this talk,
                  we will explore the contributions of these two

                  The intersection of graph searching and probabilistic
                  methods is a new topic within graph theory, with
                  applications to graph searching problems such as the
                  game of Cops and Robbers and its many variants,
                  Firefighting, graph burning, and acquaintance time.
                  Graph searching games may be played on random
                  structures such as binomial random graphs, random
                  regular graphs or random geometric graphs.
                  Probabilistic methods may also be used to understand
                  the properties of games played on deterministic
                  structures. A third and new approach is where
                  randomness figures into the rules of the game, such as
                  in the game of Zombies and Survivors. We give a broad
                  survey of graph searching and probabilistic methods,
                  highlighting the themes and trends in this emerging
                  area. The talk is based on my book (with the same
                  title) co-authored with Pawel Pralat published by CRC

                      process of the creation of new blood vessels from
                      the existing vasculature, is a necessary step in
                      tumor progression. Consequently, anti-angiogenic
                      treatments have become of particular interest in
                      cancer treatment. Despite the initial enthusiasm,
                      there have been many conflicting results
                      concerning the efficacy of anti-angiogenic
                      treatments. Hence, the benefits of such treatments
                      remain under debate. The dynamics associated with
                      treating cancer with anti-angiogenic drugs are
                      complex. These dynamics must be understood in
                      order to maximize the benefits of such a therapy.
                      We use mathematical modeling as a strategy to
                      quantify the dynamics of the interactions between
                      tumor growth, vasculature generation and
                      anti-angiogenic treatment. We have developed a
                      non-linear, mixed-effect ODE model of tumor growth
                      and treatment of colorectal cancer. Model
                      development is guided by preclinical data of from
                      colorectal tumor bearing mice treated with
                      sunitinib (anti-angiogenic). Parameters are
                      estimated in a mixed-effect fashion (i.e.
                      parameter values for both the population and each
                      individual are estimated) using the SAEM
                      (Stochastic Approximation of the Expectation
                      Maximization algorithm) algorithm. This model
                      accurately predicts tumor growth dynamics of
                      individual subjects and allows us to study the
                      multifaceted effects of anti-angiogenic treatment.
                      This study will thus help in the development of
                      evidence-based treatment protocols designed to
                      optimize the effectiveness of ant-angiogenics, and
                      eventually their combination with other cancer
                      therapies.<br>

                  an $n\times n$ matrix $A$, the celebrated
                  Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem asserts that the classical
                  numerical range $\{x^*Ax: x\in {\mathbb C}^n:
                  x^*x=1\}$ is a&nbsp; convex set, where ${\mathbb C}^n$
                  is the vector space of complex $n$-tuples and $x^*$ is
                  the complex conjugate transpose of $x\in {\mathbb
                  C}^n$. Schur-Horn Theorem asserts that the set of the
                  diagonals of Hermitian matrices of a prescribed
                  eigenvalues is the convex hull of the orbit of the
                  eigenvalues under the action of the symmetric groups.
                  These results are about unitary orbit of a matrix.
                  Among interesting generalizations, we will focus our
                  discussion on those in the context of Lie structure,
                  more precisely, compact connected Lie groups and
                  semisimple Lie algebras. Some results on convexity and

                  analysis is the relationship between the spectrum of
                  the Laplacian on a domain and that domain's geometry.
                  One approach to understanding this relationship is to
                  study domains which extremize some function of their
                  spectrum under geometric constraints. I will give a
                  brief overview of some of these optimization problems
                  and describe the (very few) explicit solutions known.
                  Then I will explain how to approach these problems
                  more abstractly, using tools from the calculus of
                  variations to find solutions. A key difficulty with
                  this approach is showing that the solutions (which are
                  a priori very weak) are actually smooth domains, which
                  I address in some recent work with Fanghua Lin. Our
                  method revolves around relating spectral optimization
                  problems to certain vector-valued free boundary
                  problems of Bernoulli type.<br>

                  &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">For curves in the plane,
                  the curvature at a point measures how fast the
                  direction is changing. If each point moves
                  perpendicularly to the loop at a speed equal to the
                  curvature, the resulting flow is called the curve
                  shortening flow. To visualize this flow, one can think
                  of the loop as the edge of a thin layer of ice
                  floating on water. Corners will round out instantly;
                  skinny offshoots disappear fast; inlets fill in; and
                  flat edges move slowly. If the ice layer is circular,
                  it will shrink while remaining circular and disappear
                  eventually. This last example is called a self-similar
                  solution because its shape does not change under the
                  flow. In higher dimensions, because so many paths go
                  through a point, one considers the mean curvature,
                  which is an average of all the curvatures of all the
                  curves through a point, and defines the mean curvature
                  flow.<br>

                  the hypercube, polychromatic colorings have proven to

                  of its applications. Flag algebras is a method,
                  developed by Razborov to attack problems in extremal
                  combinatorics. Razborov formulated the method in a
                  general way which made it applicable to various
                  settings. In this talk we give a brief introduction of
                  the basic notions used in flag algebras and
                  demonstrate the method on Mantel's theorem. Then we
                  discuss applications of the flag algebras in different
                  settings. In particular, we mention applications to
                  crossing numbers, iterated extremal structure and

                  embedded in S^3 was originally motivated by chemists‚Äô
                  need to predict molecular behavior. The symmetries of
                  a molecule can explain many of its chemical
                  properties, however we draw a distinction between
                  rigid and flexible molecules. Flexible molecules may
                  have symmetries that are not merely a combination of
                  rotations and reflections. Such symmetries prompted
                  the concept of the topological symmetry group of a
                  graph embedded in S^3. We will discuss recent work on
                  what groups are realizable as the topological symmetry
                  group for several families of graphs, including the
                  Petersen family and M√∂bius ladders.</span><span

                  it was proved that the Leech lattice provides the
                  densest way to pack spheres in 24 dimensional
                  Euclidean space. We shall talk about the infinite
                  complex reflection group G whose special properties
                  are borrowed from the Leech lattice. The group G acts
                  naturally on the unit ball in complex thirteen
                  dimensional vector space preserving a negative
                  curvature metric. Let Y be the part of the ball on
                  which G acts freely. The monstrous proposal conjecture
                  states that the fundamental group of the quotient Y/G
                  maps onto a close cousin of the monster simple group
                  and this leads to a construction of a 12 dimensional
                  complex manifold with a natural monster action. We
                  shall descibe generators and relations for the
                  fundamental group of Y/G providing strong evidence for
                  this conjecture. Part of this is joint work with
                  Daniel Allcock. There are two main ingredients in the
                  proofs: (1) making use of a still poorly understood
                  analogy between complex reflection groups and Weyl
                  groups of complex simple Lie algebras and (2) making
                  use of special properties of the Leech lattice. Along
                  the way we shall explain how this project leads us to
                  some other work of independent interest: like
                  constructing new arithmetic lattices in U(n,1) or
                  explicit uniformization of hermitian symmetric spaces

                  partially-observed framework of Markov processes with
                  marked point process observations for ultra-high
                  frequency (UHF) transaction price data, allowing other
                  observable economic or market factors. We develop the
                  corresponding Bayesian inference via filtering
                  equations to quantify parameter and model uncertainty.
                  Specifically, we derive filtering equations to
                  characterize the evolution of the statistical
                  foundation such as likelihoods, posteriors, Bayes
                  factors and posterior model probabilities. Given the
                  computational challenge, we provide a convergence
                  theorem, enabling us to employ the Markov chain
                  approximation method to construct consistent,
                  easily-parallelizable, recursive algorithms. The
                  algorithms calculate the fundamental statistical
                  characteristics and are capable of implementing the
                  Bayesian inference in real-time for streaming UHF
                  data, via parallel computing for sophisticated models.
                  The general theory is illustrated by specific models
                  built for U.S. Treasury Notes transactions data from
                  GovPX and by Heston stochastic volatility model for

                  the public hold opposing positions on a multitude of
                  social issues. For example, although there is
                  scientific consensus that climate change is occurring
                  and driven by human activity, a sampling of popular
                  media makes it clear that opposing discourses are
                  alive and well in the United States. As with many
                  social issues, there are several organizations working
                  to affect policy on climate change through grassroots
                  advocacy. Achieving success depends on a number of
                  factors, but none is perhaps more important than
                  understanding how to design campaigns for persuading
                  and mobilizing stakeholders within communities of
                  interest. In this talk, I will introduce a theoretical
                  framework to study this question using models of
                  adaptive influence on networks. Examples discussed
                  include campaigns to convert skeptics (maximizing
                  prevalence of beliefs) vs. mobilize converts
                  (maximizing extremism of beliefs). <br>
