                    <span>On the Erdos-Szekeres convex polygon problem</span></strong><br>
                </p>
                <strong>Abstract: </strong><span>The classic 1935 paper
                  of Erdos and Szekeres entitled "A combinatorial
                  problem in geometry" was a starting point of a very
                  rich discipline within combinatorics: Ramsey theory.
                  In that paper, Erdos and Szekeres studied the
                  following geometric problem. For every integer n \geq
                  3, determine the smallest integer ES(n) such that any
                  set of ES(n) points in the plane in general position
                  contains n members in convex position, that is, n
                  points that form the vertex set of a convex polygon.
                  Their main result showed that ES(n) \leq {2n -
                  4\choose n-2} + 1 = 4^{n -o(n)}. In 1960, they showed
                  that ES(n) \geq 2^{n-2} + 1 and conjectured this to be
                  optimal. Despite the efforts of many researchers, no
                  improvement in the order of magnitude has been made on
                  the upper bound over the last 81 years. In this talk,
                  we will sketch a proof showing that ES(n) =2^{n
                  +o(n)}.</span>

                <p><strong>Title: A Free Boundary Problem on Cones</strong><br>
                </p>
                <strong>Abstract: </strong><font size="1"><span
                    style="font-size:12.79px;">The one phase free
                    boundary problem shares a well-known connection to
                    area-minimizing surfaces. In this talk we review
                    this connection and then discuss the one-phase
                    problem on rough surfaces, and in particular cones.
                    After reviewing results of the author with Chang
                    Lara for the one-phase problem on two-dimensional
                    cones, we revisit the connection to area-minimizing
                    surfaces to gain insight into the problem on higher
                    dimensional cones. We then present new results on
                    when the free boundary is allowed to pass through
                    the vertex of a three-dimensional cone as well as
                    results for higher dimensional cones.&nbsp;</span></font>

                    equation</strong><br>
                </p>
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk will describe the
                use of elementary Hilbert space methods to prove results
                about solutions of boundary value problems for Laplace's
                equation. Results about the subspaces of real harmonic
                functions as subspaces of the Hilbert spaces L^2(\Omega)
                and H^m(\Omega) will be described. Boundary value
                problems for Laplace’s equation may be viewed as
                studying the linear mapping of some space of allowable
                boundary data to these Hilbert spaces.<br>
                Under natural conditions on the boundary, these are
                compact linear transformations that have a singular
                value decomposition (SVD). This SVD will be described in
                terms of Steklov eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and
                their use for efficient approximations of solutions of
                different boundary value problems will be illustrated.
                These representations of the solutions are related to
                applications such as pipe flow and electrostatic fields.

                    Rearrangement Scenarios </strong><br>
                </p>
                <strong>Abstract: </strong>Genome rearrangement is a
                common mode of molecular evolution. Representing genomes
                with edge-labelled, directed graphs, we explore three
                models for genome rearrangement - reversal, single
                cut-or-join (SCJ), and double cut-and-join (DCJ). Even
                for moderate size genomes and regardless of the model,
                there are a tremendous number of optimal rearrangement
                scenarios. When hypothesizing, giving one optimal
                solution might be misleading and cannot be used for
                statistical inference. With a focus on the SCJ model, we
                summarize the state-of-the-art in computational
                complexity and uniform sampling questions surrounding
                optimal scenarios and phylogenetic trees. <br>

                will be on equations with coefficient matrix that is
                symmetric, nonnegative definite, and both its smallest
                and largest

                are proportional to a weight with certain properties.
                The weighted estimates are obtained under a smallness
                condition on the mean oscillation of the coefficients.
                We demonstrate via a counterexample that this condition
                is necessary. The motivation for this work comes from an
                effort to obtain a fractional Sobolev regularity theory
                for fractional nonlocal problems that are defined via
                local degenerate elliptic problems. Connections between
                our weighted Sobolev estimates for degenerate problems
                and estimates for solutions of fractional elliptic
                problems will be established. [This is based on a joint

                  </strong>Regularity is a measure of the computational
                  complexity of a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial
                  ring, and thereby its associated projective
                  variety.&nbsp; There are examples in which the
                  regularity growth is doubly exponential in terms of
                  the degrees of the generators but better bounds were
                  conjectured for "nice" ideals.&nbsp; Together with
                  Irena Peeva, I discovered a construction that
                  overturned some of the conjectured bounds for "nice"
                  ideals - including the long-standing&nbsp;<span

                  Our construction involves two new ideas that we

                            popular `modularity' clustering method
                            specifices a partition of the vertex set as
                            the solution of a certain optimization
                            problem.&nbsp; In this talk, we will discuss
                            scaling limits, or `consistency' properties,
                            of this method with
                            respect to random geometric graphs
                            constructed from n points, X_1, X_2, . . .
                            ,X_n, drawn independently according to a
                            probability measure supported on a bounded
                            domain in R^d, edges being placed between

                            A main result is the following:&nbsp;
                            Suppose the number of clusters, or
                            partitioning sets of V_n, is bounded above
                            by a fixed level, then we show that the
                            discrete optimal modularity partitions
                            converge, as n grows, in a specific sense to
                            a continuum partition
                            of the underlying domain, characterized as

                <p><strong>Title: Using the Lovász Local Lemma in
                    asymptotic enumeration</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since its introduction
                  in 1975, the Lovász Local Lemma (LLL) has been the
                  tool of probabilistic combinatorics to find the
                  proverbial needle in the haystack. The conclusion of
                  LLL is that "none of n events occur" has positive
                  probability, and the key concept for the LLL is the
                  dependency graph. In 1991, Erdős and Spencer observed
                  that LLL still works (with minimal changes in the
                  proof), if the dependency graph is relaxed to a
                  negative dependency graph. The difficulty of using
                  their observation is that independence usually has
                  clear combinatorial reasons and is easy to see, if it
                  is there. Showing the correlation required for the
                  negative dependency graph is less straightforward,
                  hence the Erdős-Spencer result found few applications.
                  In joint papers with Lincoln Lu (and in part with
                  Austin Mohr) we defined some generic types of events
                  in the space of random perfect matchings of complete
                  graphs (and in analogous situations), where negative
                  dependency graphs arise. For these types of events we
                  managed to provide a good upper bound for the
                  probability that "none of the n events occur". These
                  results have many applications to graph and hypergraph
                  enumeration (even derangements can be counted using
                  LLL!) though often we do not obtain the strongest
                  known results. A classic existential result of Erdős
                  (1961) showed that for any given g and k, there are
                  graphs with girth at least g and chromatic number at
                  least k. Using the methods described above, one can
                  obtain a universal result: almost all graphs with
                  prescribed degree sequence and girth at least g are
                  not k-colorable under suitable conditions on the
                  degree sequence and k. </p>

                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Monte Carlo algorithms
                  are often used in problems involving high dimensional
                  integration. Application include finding maximum
                  likelihood estimators, Bayes Factors for model
                  selection, and approximation of #P complete problems.
                  Often, the output of these algorithms is treated as
                  data that comes from regular experiments, and
                  classical statistical estimators are used. In this
                  talk, I will present ways to take advantage of the
                  fact that this data comes from Monte Carlo experiments
                  to give estimates for the mean of Bernoulli and
                  Poisson random variables with the remarkable property
                  that the relative error in these estimates does not
                  depend on the quantity being estimated, but is instead
                  user-specified. That is, the user can decide ahead of
                  time on the distribution of the relative error of
                  these estimates. This gives a simple framework for
                  exact confidence intervals for these estimates that
                  are highly accurate even out in the tails where
                  central limit approximations are inappropriate. </p>

                  ergodic theorem and KPZ universality, but to few
                  theorems. I will describe this model and the

                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> My talk will explore how
                  first passage time problems are used to model
                  molecular transport in biology. Cellular environments
                  are typically crowded and highly heterogeneous. Even
                  if large molecular species are not directly involved
                  in a given reaction, they can influence it through
                  steric interactions. By modeling the random motion of
                  individual molecules in heterogeneous environments,
                  first passage time statistics can be used to
                  understand the dynamics of complex physiological
                  processes. I will discuss two examples. (i) First, I
                  will show how antibodies are dynamically tuned to
                  anchor large nanoparticles, such as viruses, to
                  constitutive elements of a mucin polymer gel. Mucus is
                  a vital component of our immune system and provides a
                  first line of defense against infection. Large
                  nanoparticles such as bacteria are trapped within the
                  tangled polymer network, preventing contact with the
                  mucus membrane and subsequent infection. However, some
                  nanoparticles, such as certain viruses, are small
                  enough that they can freely diffuse through the
                  polymer matrix. One hypothesis for how smaller
                  nanoparticles could be trapped is that they are
                  crosslinked to the mucin network by antibodies.
                  Indeed, antibodies are present in large quantities
                  within mucus. However, the hypothesis was previously
                  discounted because antibodies typically have very weak
                  affinity for mucin. Counter to the prevailing theory
                  that antibodies are only effective if they have strong
                  affinity to mucin, I will show how weak affinity and
                  rapid binding kinetics substantially improves their
                  ability to trap large nanoparticles. (ii) In the
                  second half of my talk I will present theoretical
                  support for a hypothesis about cell-cell contact,
                  which plays a critical role in immune function. A
                  fundamental question for all cell-cell interfaces is
                  how receptors and ligands come into contact, despite
                  being separated by large molecules, the extracellular
                  fluid, and other structures in the glycocalyx. The
                  cell membrane is a crowded domain filled with large
                  glycoproteins that impair interactions between smaller
                  pairs of molecules, such as the T cell receptor and
                  its ligand, which is a key step in immunological
                  information processing and decision-making. A first
                  passage time problem allows us to gauge whether a
                  reaction zone can be cleared of large molecules
                  through passive diffusion on biologically relevant
                  timescales. I combine numerical and asymptotic
                  approaches to obtain a complete picture of the first
                  passage time, which shows that passive diffusion alone
                  would take far too long to account for experimentally
                  observed cell-cell contact formation times. The result
                  suggests that cell-cell contact formation may involve
                  previously unknown active mechanical processes. </p>

                    Recognition and Symmetry Detection </strong><br>
                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract: </strong>In many engineering
                  applications, the objects of interest are either
                  invariant under certain groups of transformations or
                  are characterized by certain types symmetries. In this
                  talk, we will present object representation methods
                  that exploit such invariances or symmetries in order
                  to be more application friendly (e.g., less
                  computation or more robustness.) To illustrate how
                  invariances can be exploited in applications, we will
                  begin with the case of an object represented by a set
                  of points in a vector space. We will assume that the
                  object is unchanged by a (simultaneous) rigid motion
                  of all the points, as well as a reordering of the
                  points. (For example, the points could represent the
                  minutia of a fingerprint image.) In this case, we
                  showed that any generic such object can be represented
                  without any loss of information by the multi-set of
                  (unordered) pairwise distances between the points.
                  This "bag of pairwise distances" representation can
                  also be viewed as the distribution of an invariant
                  (the distance). More generally, invariant statistics
                  can be used to represent complex (generic) objects
                  without any information loss. For example, we will
                  describe how complete weighted graphs can be
                  represented by two invariant statistics; for a generic
                  choice of weights, these statistics are a lossless
                  representation of the original graph. This allows for
                  quick comparison (polynomial time) of two generic
                  graphs modulo isomorphism. To illustrate how
                  symmetries can be exploited in applications, we will
                  look at the problem of recognizing an image
                  representing an object with a known symmetry. We will
                  present a new representation called the Pascal
                  Triangle of the image, which is written in terms of
                  complex moments of the image and has a direct
                  connection with the radon transform. We will show how
                  different types of symmetries manifest themselves in
                  the Pascal triangle, and show how we applied these
                  observation to quickly recognize HAZMAT signs (which
                  are characterized by a 4-fold rotational symmetry)
                  using a smart phone equipped with a camera. We will
                  finish the talk by briefly discussing other (current
                  and future) signal processing and machine learning
                  problems where geometry plays an important role. </p>

                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract: Computability
                  theory is the mathematical study of the limits and
                  potentialities of discrete computing devices.
                  Computable analysis is the theory of computing with
                  continuous data such as real numbers. Computable
                  structure theory examines which
                  computability-theoretic properties are possessed by
                  the structures in various classes such as partial
                  orders, Abelian groups, and Boolean algebras. Until
                  recently computable structure theory has focused on
                  classes of countable algebraic structures and has
                  neglected the uncountable structures that occur in
                  analysis such as metric spaces and Banach spaces.
                  However, a program has now emerged to use computable
                  analysis to broaden the purview of computable
                  structure theory so as to include analytic structures.
                  The solutions of some of the resulting problems have
                  involved a blend of methods from functional analysis
                  and classical computability theory. We will discuss
                  progress so far on metric spaces and Banach spaces, in
                  particular $\ell^p$ spaces, as well as open problems

                <p><strong>Title: Harmonic analysis on fractals </strong><br>
                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> We study spectral
                  duality for singular measures \mu. Complex Hadamard
                  matrices is one source of such examples, and there are
                  others. The main question is to decide when L^2( \mu)
                  will have an orthogonal Fourier basis; i.e., when is
                  there a fractal Fourier transform? Not so for the
                  middle-third Cantor! Nonetheless, Jorgensen and
                  Pedersen [JoPe98] showed that spectral duality does
                  hold for the middle-1/4 Cantor measure. Higher
                  dimensional L^2 fractals are associated to certain
                  Complex Hadamard matrices. For affine fractals, the
                  distribution of Fourier frequencies satisfies very
                  definite lacunary properties, in the form of geometric
                  almost gaps; the size of the gaps grows exponentially,
                  with sparsity between partitions. Motivated by wavelet
                  analysis (on fractals), R. Strichartz showed (shortly
                  after [JoPe98] ) that these lacunary Fourier series
                  offer better convergence properties than the classical
                  counterparts; one reason is that, like wavelets, they
                  are better localized. Another family of Cantor spaces
                  we study arise as limits of infinite discrete models;
                  e.g., infinite weighted graphs from electrical
                  networks with resistors. Then the Cantor spaces arise
                  as boundaries; for example, Poisson boundaries, Shilov
                  boundaries, Martin boundaries, path-space boundaries,
                  and metric boundaries. </p>

                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> On the two-dimensional
                  square lattice, call each nearest-neighbor bond
                  ``open'' with probability 1/2 and ``closed'' with
                  probability 1/2, each independently. Conditioned on
                  the existence of an open left-right crossing path of a
                  box of side-length n, it was shown by
                  Aizenman-Burchard that, with high probability, the
                  shortest crossing has at least n^{1+\epsilon} edges,
                  for some \epsilon&gt;0. It was also shown by
                  Morrow-Zhang that the *lowest* crossing has order
                  n^{4/3} edges. In 1992, Kesten and Zhang asked if the
                  shortest crossing has the same length as the lowest
                  crossing. Specifically, conditioned on the existence
                  of an open crossing, does the ratio of the length of
                  the shortest crossing to the length of the lowest
                  crossing go to zero in probability as n tends to
                  infinity? I will talk about these questions, and joint
                  work with J. Hanson and P. Sosoe in which we show that
                  the answer to the Kesten-Zhang question is yes. </p>

                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> The idea of a fractional
                  derivative dates back to the final years of the
                  seventeenth century. It had its rigorous mathematical
                  foundations in the mid-nineteenth century and was a
                  nearly complete theory by 1970. Work on physical
                  models of diffusion over the last 50 years has
                  indicated that traditional assumptions based on
                  Einstein's formulation of Brownian motion may not hold
                  in general and instead of a Gaussian process and the
                  heat equation being the basic building block, current
                  thinking has taken this into the realm of fractional
                  differential operators. We will explore this avenue
                  and show how fractional calculus plays a role. We will
                  also ask questions about the qualitative behaviour of
                  fractional PDEs and how/why this may differ from the
                  traditional elliptic/parabolic equation cases.
                  Finally, we ask about inverse problems: can we recover
                  unknown coefficients and initial/boundary conditions
                  from these models and will the answers be very similar
                  to the classical case? We will show the answer to the
                  first question is a qualified ``yes'' and for the
                  second question the answer is ``sometimes, but
                  certainly not always.'' </p>

                <p><strong>Title: Flutter Dynamics: The Waltz of the
                    Wave and Plate Equations </strong><br>
                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> When a thin elastic
                  structure is immersed in a fluid flow, certain
                  conditions may bring about excitations in the
                  structure. That is, the ``dynamic loading" of the
                  fluid couples with ``natural oscillatory modes" of the
                  structure. In this case we have a bounded-response
                  feedback, and the oscillatory behavior persists until
                  the flow velocity changes or energy is dissipated from
                  the structure. This interactive phenomenon is referred
                  to as flutter. Beyond the obvious applications in
                  aeroscience (projectile paneling and flaps, flags, and
                  airfoils), the flutter phenomenon arises in: (i) the
                  biomedical realm (in treating sleep apnea), and (ii)
                  sustainable energies (in providing a low-cost power
                  generating mechanisms). Modeling flutter, and
                  predicting, controlling, and preventing (or bringing
                  about) its emergence has been a foremost problem in
                  engineering for nearly 70 years. In this talk we
                  describe the basics of modeling flutter in the
                  simplest configuration (an aircraft panel) using
                  differential equations and dynamical systems. After
                  discussing the partial differential equations model,
                  we will discuss theorems that can be proved about
                  solutions to these equations using modern analysis
                  (e.g., nonlinear functional analysis, semigroups,
                  monotone operator theory, the theory of global
                  attractors, elliptic theory). We will relate these
                  results back to (experimental) results in engineering
                  and recent numerical work. We will also describe very
                  recent (and very open) problems in the analysis of
                  wing and flag configurations, where a portion of the
                  structure is unsupported. </p>

                </p>
                <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> In 1934, J. Schauder
                  first established by now well-known Schauder estimates
                  for linear elliptic equations, which became an
                  indispensable tool in the theory of partial
                  differential equations. For fully nonlinear concave
                  elliptic equations, such result was obtained by M. V.
                  Safonov in 1988, following the seminal work of L. C.
                  Evans and N. V. Krylov in early 1980s. I will present
                  a recent work on Schauder estimates for a class of
                  concave fully nonlinear nonlocal elliptic and
                  parabolic equations with rough and non-symmetric
                  kernels, where the data are allowed to be bounded and
                  measurable. A further Dini type estimate will also be
                  discussed. </p>
