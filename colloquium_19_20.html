              <b>Abstract:</b> Fracture prediction is an ongoing
              challenge in materials science and computational science
              and engineering. Peridynamics offer a new framework for
              computational modeling of fractures which overcomes this
              challenge through governing equations that naturally
              represent material discontinuities. Peridynamics is a
              nonlocal reformulation of classical continuum mechanics
              suitable for material failure and damage simulation. </font><font
              size="+2">This presentation will discuss computational and
              modeling aspects of peridynamics with applications. We
              will begin by providing an overview of the peridynamic
              theory of solid mechanics, its computational features, and
              its capabilities in modeling crack propagation in
              isotropic and anisotropic media, including brittle glass
              and steel, fiber-reinforced composites, and
              polycrystalline ceramics. We will then present recent
              advances in modeling highly anisotropic media in
              peridynamics with a specialization to two-dimensional and
              planar elasticity problems.<br>

              <b>Title:</b> On the degrees of complexity of algebraic
              varieties<br>
              <b>Abstract:</b> Given a system of polynomial equations in
              several variables, there are several natural questions
              regarding its associated solution set (algebraic variety):
              What is its dimension? Is it smooth or are there
              singularities? How is it embedded in affine/projective
              space? Free resolutions encode answers to all of these
              questions and are computable with modern computer algebra
              programs. This begs the question: can one bound the
              computational complexity of a variety in terms of readily
              available data? I will discuss two recently solved
              conjectures of Stillman and Eisenbud-Goto, how they relate
              to each other, and what they say about the complexity of
              algebraic varieties.</font><br>

                administration of justice<br>
                <b>Abstract:</b> In criminal proceedings, we often wish
                to know whether the suspect was the source of the
                evidence at the crime scene. The prosecutor and the
                defense propose competing hypothesis: the defendant is
                the source of the evidence or someone else is the source
                of the evidence. The task of the forensic scientist is
                to determine whether the evidence favors the
                prosecutor's or the defense's propositions. We focus on
                pattern evidence (latent prints, tool marks, etc) and
                discuss approaches to quantify the similarity between
                two images. If two items are similar, does that indicate
                same source? We use firearms examination for

                    <b>Abstract: </b>Riemannian manifolds with no
                    conjugate points or no focal points are natural
                    generalizations of those with nonpositive sectional
                    curvature, but they are defined using synthetic
                    conditions about geodesics rather than strict
                    curvature bounds. In this talk, it will be shown
                    that the foundational theorems of Eells-Sampson and
                    Hartman about maps from manifolds with nonnegative
                    Ricci curvature into those with nonpositive
                    sectional curvature, initially proved using the heat
                    flow and the Bochner identity for harmonic maps,
                    generalize to targets with no focal points by an
                    essentially geometric, rather than analytical,
                    argument. The extent to which other classical
                    splitting theorems generalize to manifolds with no
                    conjugate points will also be discussed, along with
                    recent results about their fundamental groups and
                    applications to other questions to Riemannian
                    geometry.<br>

                      singular stochastic Hamiltonian systems<br>
                      <b>Abstract: </b>We discuss the problem of
                      convergence to equilibrium in two stochastic
                      differential equations used in statistical
                      sampling algorithms. In each system, the
                      equilibrium probability distribution has an
                      explicit density which is known up to a
                      normalization constant. Moreover, each density is
                      of the Boltzmann-Gibbs form. In the context of the
                      algorithm, this form is exploited in order to take
                      samples from a wide array of probability
                      distributions by running the stochastic dynamics
                      "long enough" started from conveniently chosen
                      prior distributions. However, outside of a
                      particular class of target distributions, very
                      little is known about how fast the stochastic
                      dynamics converges to this equilibrium. This talk
                      will cover joint work with my collaborators to
                      bridge this gap, ultimately resolving a challenge
                      posed by Denis Talay at an AIM conference in 2007

                        <b>Abstract:</b> Advances in technology are
                        challenging traditional concepts of the when,
                        where, and how of work. Employees no longer
                        spend their entire career at one job. The Bureau
                        of Labor Statistics reports that the average
                        tenure of current workers is 4.6 years and that
                        this number decreases with employee age. In
                        2018, Gallup reported that 43% of US workers are
                        remote at least sometimes. Moreover, as measured
                        by FlexJobs in 2018, the math and economics job
                        category had the highest growth in remote job
                        opportunities. Finally, it should be noted that
                        the fourth industrial revolution has created a
                        high demand and a shortage of some critical
                        skills and highlighted the need for employers to

                        employing people with a wide range of skills
                        that can be readily adapted to the new areas. To
                        respond to these new realities, companies have
                        turned to the practice of people analytics, a
                        data-driven approach to managing the workforce.
                        In this talk, we will describe how people
                        analytics has matured and give some examples of
                        problems and studies in this space. We will
                        focus on the data-driven nature of the work and
                        the mathematical tools required to find
                        insights.<br>

                            discuss the connections between
                            symmetrization and extremal functions of
                            graphs that exclude both a triangle and some
                            fixed bipartite graph. In some cases the
                            extremal number can be determined
                            asymptotically. The techniques arise from
                            the study of the edit distance problem. This

                              assimilation for hurricane storm surge
                              modeling applications<br>
                              <b>Abstract:</b> Coastal ocean models are
                              used for a variety of applications,
                              including the simulation of tides and
                              hurricane storm surges. As is true for
                              many numerical models, coastal ocean
                              models are plagued with uncertainty, due
                              to factors including but not limited to
                              the numerical discretization of continuous
                              processes, uncertainties in specified
                              boundary and initial conditions, and the
                              approximation of meteorological conditions
                              and hydrodynamics. Quantifying and
                              reducing these uncertainties is essential
                              for developing reliable and robust storm
                              surge models. Statistical data
                              assimilation methods are often used to
                              estimate uncertain model states (e.g.
                              storm surge heights) by combining model
                              output with uncertain observations. We
                              have used these methods in storm surge
                              modeling applications to reduce
                              uncertainties resulting from coarse
                              spatial resolution. While state estimation
                              is beneficial for accurately simulating
                              the surge resulting from a single,
                              observed storm, larger contributions can
                              be made with the estimation of uncertain
                              model parameters. In this talk, I will
                              discuss applications of statistical data
                              assimilation methods for both state and
                              parameter estimation in coastal ocean
